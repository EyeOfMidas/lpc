NAME
	catch - catch any errors that may occur.
SYNTAX
	mixed catch(mixed expr);

DESCRIPTION
	Evaluate expr. If there is no error, 0 is returned. If there is a
	standard error, a string (with a leading '*') will be returned.
	The function throw(value) can be used to immediately return
	a string to a pending catch().

NOTA BENE
	The catch() is somewhat costly, and should not be used just anywhere.
	Rather it should be used at places where an error would destroy
	consistency.
