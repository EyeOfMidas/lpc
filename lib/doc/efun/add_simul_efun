NAME
	add_simul_efun - add a simul_efun
	
SYNTAX
	void add_simul_efun(string name,function fun);
	or
	void add_simul_efun(string name);
	
DESCRIPTION
	add_simul_efun sets up a function to be used as a simul_efun. What this
	means is that the function fun will work almost like an efun, and can
	be accessed from any object. (compiled after the call to
	add_simul_efun) The second syntax turns a simul_efun off, ie. those
	programs that has already linked to it can still use it, but it will
	not be available for programs compiled later. If you use the first
	syntax, and there is already a simul efun with that name, the old one
	will be replaced, and _all_ programs will use the new function.
	(not just those compiled later)

EXAMPLE
	/* This adds a function "linebreak" to the list of simul_efuns */
	add_simul_efun("linebreak",lambda(string s,int cols)
          {
            if(!cols) cols=78;
            return sprintf("%-=*s\n",cols,s);
          }

	/* This simulates the old simul_efun behaviour */
	function *f;
	f=get_function_list((object)"/secure/simul_efun");
	for(e=0;e<sizeof(f);e++)
	  add_simul_efun(function_name(f[e]),f);
