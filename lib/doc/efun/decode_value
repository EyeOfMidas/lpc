NAME
	decode_value - decode a string coded with code_value

SYNTAX

DESCRIPTION
	This is the inverse function of code_value, it takes a string that
	was produced with code_value (or any string in the same format) and
	decodes it and returns the value.

	Objects can only be decoded if they have same hash_name as when
	they were coded.
