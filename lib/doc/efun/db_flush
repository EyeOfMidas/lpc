NAME
	db_flush - flush all database caches

SYNTAX
	void db_flush();

DESCRIPTION
	This function will flush all the caches used by the database functions.
	Normally you won't have to use this function, but if you intend to do
	normal file-access (not with the db_* functions) on databases, you
	must run this function first. The one exception is rm(), rm always
	runs this function.

SEE ALSO
	db_set, db_get, db_indices, rm
