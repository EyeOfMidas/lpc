NAME
	read_file - read lines from a file

SYNTAX
	string read_file(string file,int start_line,int nr_lines);
	or
	string read_file(string file,int start_line);
	or
	string read_file(string file);

DESCRIPTION
	Reads lines of text from a file into a string. For examples on
	how this is useful, look at the grep code in the player object.
	The string can then be sscanf'd, etc or manipulated in anyway
	seen fit.  The start_line is the line number of the line you wish
	to read, nr_lines i s the number of lines you want to read.
        This routine will return 0 if you try to read past the end of
        the file, or if you try to read from a nonpositive line.

        Note that the driver imposes a limit to the number of bytes you're
	allowed to read at one time, usually 50Kb. If you try to read more
	than this read file will return zero.

	If you don't give an end_line, read_file will try to read to the
	end of the file. If you don't give a start_line either, it will
	try to read the whole file.
