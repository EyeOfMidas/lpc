NAME
	allocate - allocate an array
SYNTAX
	mixed *allocate(int size);
	mixed *allocate(int size,int size2,int size3, ...);

DESCRIPTION
	Allocate an array of size elements. The number of elements must be
	>= 0 and when running in mudlib (as opposed to script mode) not
	bigger than MAX_ARRAY_SIZE (normally 5000).  If the second syntax
	is given allocate will allocate a n-dimensional array with the size
	size x size2 x size3 x ... note that this is accomplished by
	allocating an array an filling it with arrrays, and then filling
	them with arrays and so on.

NOTA BENE
	Arrays are dynamically allocated there is no need to declare them
	like int a[10]=allocate(10); (and it isn't possible either) like
	in C, just int *a=allocate(10); will do.

SEE ALSO
	sizeof, pointerp
