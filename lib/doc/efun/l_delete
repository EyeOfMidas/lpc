NAME
	l_delete - delete a member in a list

SYNTAX
	list l_delete(list l,mixed m);

DESCRIPTION
	Remove the member m from the list l, and return the first argument.
	Could be written l=l-(<m>) but l_delete is faster if you delete
	only one member.

NOTA BENE
	l_delete is destructive, that is if you write a=l_delete(b,c)
	the member c will be deleted in b, and a will be a pointer to the
	same list as b.

	l_sizeof, indices, listp
