NAME
	update - invalid a program for cloning

SYNTAX
	int update(string);

DESCRIPTION
	Invalid a program for cloning. Return 0 if no such program was loaded.
	Next time a clone is attempted on that program it will be reloaded
	from disk.

NOTA BENE
	Even though there is a new program in memory, the old clones will
	continue to use the old program, therefor the memory associated
	with the old program can not be freed until all clones from it
	are destructed.
