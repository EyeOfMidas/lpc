NAME
	write - write a message

SYNTAX
	void write(mixed str);

DESCRIPTION
	Write a message str to current player. str can also be a number,
	which will be translated to a string. If there is no this_player()
	the message will be sent to stdout. Note that this just calls
	catch_tell in this_player(), it doesn't 'send' it.
