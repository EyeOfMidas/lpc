NAME
	dumpallobj - dump all obj  :)

SYNTAX
	string dumpallobj();

DESCRIPTION
	Return a pseudo-readable list of all objects currently cloned in
	a string. The string will roughly look like the old /OBJ_DUMP
	file. That is, something like this:

<filename>(<clone_number>) <size> ref <HB> <HASHED> <environment> <cpu>
	
BUGS
	The documentation could be better
