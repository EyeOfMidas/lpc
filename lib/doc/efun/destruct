NAME
	destruct - destruct an object
SYNTAX
	void destruct()
	void destruct(object ob)

DESCRIPTION
	Completely destroy and remove this_object. After the call to
	destruct(), no global variables will exist any longer, only local,
	and arguments.

	When an object self-destructs, it will immediately terminate
	execution and return 0. There is one exception: If the
	destruct-statement is followed by a return 1; immediately after,
	then this return statement will be executed.

	If an argument is given then it will try to destruct that object,
	but it will ask the masterobject for permission first by calling
	master->query_valid_destruct()

	Normally you don't use destruct() to dispose of another object,
	instead you use obj->selfdestruct().

SEE ALSO
	clone_object.
