NAME
	clone_object - clone an object from a given program

SYNTAX
	object clone_object(string file);

DESCRIPTION
	Clone an object from a program loaded from file file. If no such
	program is loaded the driver will attempt to load a program from
	that name. If the filename contains a '#' the part before the #
	will be considered the filename and the rest will be sent as an
	argument to create(). This way you can do objects that initialize
	themself easily.
