NAME
	regexp - match an array of strings against a regular expression

SYNTAX
	string *regexp(string *strs,regular_expression reg);

DESCRIPTION
	Return an array of all in strs strings that matched the regular
	expression reg. For more information about regular expression
	see your unix manuals or the infopages in your emacs.

NOTA BENE
	Regular expressions uses a kind of compilation, therefor it is
	MUCH faster to match an array like this than to match one per
	call.

	sscanf
