NAME
	add_action - add a command to this_player()
	
SYNTAX
	void add_action(string fun,string command,int priority);
	void add_action(string fun,string command,int priority,mixed extra);
	
DESCRIPTION
	add_action() enables this_player() to use the string command at the
	prompt. If how is zero or not suppied command is sent to sscanf() and
	a matching process is done (if command contains any '%' that is) the
	function fun will then be called with the arguments from the match.
	If how is not zero it will specify that command shall be sent to
	parse_command() instead of sscanf() and it will also specify where
	parse_command() shall look for it's objects.  The optional extra
	argument will be sent to the function after the matching arguments.
	The priority number determines if this action should be tried to
	matched before or after other actions. Higher priority means before
	other add_actions.
