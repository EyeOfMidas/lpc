NAME
	copy_value - copy a value recursively

SYNTAX
	mixed copy_value(mixed arg);

DESCRIPTION
	Copies mappings, lists and arrays recursively, that is, it doesn't
	just copy the pointer and add a reference, but allocates new memory
	and copies all the values in the arrays/mappings/lists.
	Thus, if a is an array, is_equal(a,copy_value(a)) is true, but
	a == copy_value(a) is false.

SEE ALSO
	is_equal
