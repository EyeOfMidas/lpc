NAME
	sort_array - sort an array

SYNTAX
	mixed *sort_array(mixed *arr,function fun);
	or
	mixed *sort_array(mixed *arr);

DESCRIPTION
	The first syntax sorts an array after a compare-function fun
	which takes two arguments and should return 1 if the first argument
	is larger then the second.
	The second syntax sorts automatically, so that ints are sorted in
	numerical order for themselves, strings in alphabetical order for
	themselves and the rest of the types are sorted in random order
	but the types are separated. Objects for themselves, arrays for
	themselves etc. etc.

SEE ALSO
	map_array, filter_array
