NAME
	is_equal - check if two values are equal

SYNTAX
	int is_equal(mixed a,mixed b);

DESCRIPTION
	Returns 1 if the two arguments are equal, note that they do not have
	to be the same values, ie. if two arrays are compared, it is enough
	that all their indexes are equal, they do not have to be the same
	array, as is the case with ==.

	copy_value
