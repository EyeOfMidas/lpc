NAME
	init - do some initializations

SYNTAX
	void init() { ... }

DESCRIPTION
	init is called when:

	o   a 'living' object is moved into this_object()
	o   a 'living' object is moved to the same environment as this_object()
	o   this_object() is moved the the same environment as a 'living'
	o   this_object() is moved into a 'living'

	Note that one call to move_object() can cause several calls to init.
	The idea is that add_actions are supposed to be put into this function.
