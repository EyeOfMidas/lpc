NAME
	exit - notify that an object is leaving

SYNTAX
	void exit(object o) { ... }

DESCRIPTION
	This function is called when an object is moved from your object.
	The object moved is given as an argument.

BUGS
	There is also an efun called exit(), but it can only be called when
	in batch mode, and it can still be called like efun::exit(). There
	will be a problem if you wish to redefine exit() though...
