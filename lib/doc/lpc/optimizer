LPC4 features an optimizer, this can cause some strange effects from time
to time, which I will try to describe here:

	o 1/0 is a compiler error, not a run-time error, as lpc4 tries to
	  evaluate it during compilation.

	o The optimizer will sometimes remove code that would otherwize
	  yield errors, for instance (void)(1/zero) will always be removed
	  even if zero is 0.
