DESCRIPTION
	List is a type used mostly for set operations. If you use & and | to
	set/unset member then you a member will only appear once. If you use
	+ and - then a member can appear any number of times. If l is a list
	then l[ind] will return 1 if ind is a member in l oterwise 0. You can
	not set a member in a list like his l[ind]=1; use l |= (<ind>); or
	l += (<ind>); instead. The internal representation if a list is equal
	to a mapping without any data.
