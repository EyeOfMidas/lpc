DESCRIPTION
	A mapping is basically an array that can be indexed on any type, not
	not just integers. It can also be seen as a way of linking data
	(usaully strings) together. It consists of a lot of index-data pairs
	which are linked togeter in such a way that map[index1] returns data1.
	It is also possible to set that data by writing map[index1]=new_data1.
	If you try to set an index in a mapping that isn't already present in
	the mapping then it will be added.
