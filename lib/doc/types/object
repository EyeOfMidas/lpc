NAME
	object - the objectpointer type

SYNTAX
	There is no way of writing a constant objectpointer, but all efuns
	that takes an object as an argument can take a string with it's
	hash_name instead. If no object is found with that hash_name, it
	will be loaded. (except for find_object which returns 0 instead
	of loading)

OPERATORS
	->
	objectp, find_object, this_object, first_inventory, next_inventory,
	all_inventory, environment, clone_object

DESCRIPTION
	Objectpointers are references to objects. If the object pointed to
	is destructed the pointer will become 0.
