NAME
	string - a dynamic string type

SYNTAX
	"abcedefg"

OPERATORS
	[], [..], +, /, 
	stringp, extract, explode, implode, sscanf, sprintf, strstr

DESCRIPTION
	Strings in lpc are similar to strings in basic. They are NOT an array
	of 'char' as the type 'char' does not exist in lpc. They have an
	unlimited size but can not contain zeros, as zero is used to mark the
	end of the string. You can not set a character within a string like
	this str[10]='a', but you can get a character from a string with
	almost the same syntax: c=str[10];
