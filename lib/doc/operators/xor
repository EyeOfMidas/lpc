NAME
	^ - bitwise xor

SYNTAX
	int a,b,c;
	c = a ^ b;

	or

	list a,b,c;
	c = a ^ b;

	or

	mixed *a,*b,*c;
	c = a ^ b;

	or

	mapping a,b,c;
	a=b ^ c;

DESCRIPTION
	First case: ^ returns a number with all bits that are set in a or
		    b but not in both.

	Second case: ^ returns a list with all members that are present in
		eiter a or b, but not both.

	Third case is equal to indices(mklist(a) ^ mklist(b));

	Fourth case: ^ returns a mapping with all indices that are present
		in either a or b, but not both. Data for the indices will be
